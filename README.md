# 🍱 Zulja Catering Intelligent System

An AI-powered dashboard designed to automate data entry and forecast demand for a Malaysian catering SME. This project transforms unstructured "Manglish" (Malay-English) WhatsApp orders into actionable business intelligence.

## 🚀 Features

* **🤖 AI Order Extraction:** Uses OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) to parse messy text orders into structured data (Date, Pax, Menu, Location).
* **🔮 Demand Forecasting:** Uses Random Forest (Scikit-Learn) to predict future monthly pax volume based on historical seasonality.
* **📊 Business Intelligence:** Interactive Streamlit dashboard visualizing Revenue by Event Type, Weekly Demand, and geospatial delivery heatmaps.
* **🗺️ Location & Product Intelligence:** Automatically extracts delivery venues and menu items to optimize logistics and inventory.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/zulja-intelligence.git](https://github.com/yourusername/zulja-intelligence.git)
    cd zulja-intelligence
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI Key:
    ```text
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
    ```

4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 📂 Project Structure

* `app.py`: The main Streamlit dashboard application.
* `seed_data.py`: A utility script to "seed" the database by processing historical raw data through the LLM.
* `train_model.py`: Retrains the Random Forest prediction model using the latest data.
* `catering_model.pkl`: The saved machine learning model.
* `cleaned_revenue_data.csv`: The database of structured orders (Generated by the system).

## 🧠 Model & Approach

* **Extraction:** We use Few-Shot Prompting with GPT-4o to handle inconsistent formatting in WhatsApp messages.
* **Forecasting:** We chose Random Forest Regressor over Linear Regression to better capture non-linear seasonal trends (e.g., Ramadan dips and Syawal spikes).
